# Exploring CIA Factbook Using SQL

This is my very first project using SQL in Jupiter Notebook.

The data are from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 

To download the database - [factbook.db](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db)

Here are the descriptions for some of the columns:

	•	name - The name of the country.
	•	area- The country's total area (both land and water).
	•	area_land - The country's land area in square kilometers.
	•	area_water - The country's waterarea in square kilometers.
	•	population - The country's population.
	•	population_growth- The country's population growth as a percentage.
	•	birth_rate - The country's birth rate, or the number of births a year per 1,000 people.
	•	death_rate - The country's death rate, or the number of death a year per 1,000 people.
	•	migration_rate - The country’s migration rate.

Below are some questions that I was trying to address with this analysis:

1.	Getting an overview of the data.

2.	Exploration of the population: 
- Minimum and maximum,
- Average population.
  
3.	Exploring the data regarding the density. 
  
4.	Analysing the data regarding the growth of the population:
- Finding the country that have the highest growth rate, and
- the countries that will add the most people to their population. 
  
5.	Exploring data regarding water area:
- Country with the highest water area,
- Countries that have more water than land, 
- Countries with the highest ratio of water to land. 
  
6.	Finding out which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate.
  
7.	Discovering countries with the highest migration rate.
